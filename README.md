## Description
This is a web application designed to help calculate how much is owed to a restaurant I work for after delivering pizza. It is designed for mobile use which is why it might not look too good on a desktop environment.

## Bill
A bill consists of the amount the order costs, the total amount payed in debit (tip included) if the order was not payed cash, an exterior bonus (if the delivery was a certain distance from the restaurant we are given extra tip for the gas), and if it was uber the amount that was tipped.

## Calculation
When all the bills are added we subtract the total cost of all the pizzas (Receipt Amount) and subtract the total amount payed in debit + exteriors/uber tips and that will tell you how much is owed to the restaurant.
